# started with the python lec 
# just a few points that we are going over some of them might include 
# *important points:
# 1)use librays you will find one that helps you
# 2)will learn how to use files with python
# 3)there is no malloc in other words dynamic memory allocation
# 4)will be use google colab environment 
# 5)we are still free to use our own editor
# 6)the colab looks good might use that but not sure yet
# his code did look good on VScode
#when you start debugging make sure you reset the runtime environment by clicking "restart and run all"
#when exiting the run log will be cleared so we have to run the entire code again.
#+ for strings in python will just connect them together
#gotta do some casting in some cases

if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
x=x+1
